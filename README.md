Each team is to select one of the following games below to develop for
your project. I have given you a program based on a previously
designed program that needs to be completed and/or modified in some
way. The required contents of each program are listed below. 

Blackjack
The original program is a Number Guessing Game. Player deposits an
initial amount to start playing game. He guess a number between 1
and 10 and enters a betting amount. If he wins he will get 10 times
the money he bets. If he bets a wrong number he will lose his
betting amount. Game continues till user wants to stop play.


You will create a game of blackjack:
- Player plays against a dealer (computer)
- He sets the amount he has to play with, then places a bet for
each hand.
- The first card is given for both players, then the user is asked
if they would like another card.
- If the value exceeds 21 the player gets a bust. When the player
asks for no more cards their hand is compared to the dealer to
determine the winner.
- Actual cards symbols should be displayed (2, 3, 4, K, Q, J, A,
etc.
The program should include:
- Loop
- Function
- Array
- Rand
- Branching or Switch
Program Format:

Each Participant should be able to:
- Explain each line of code
